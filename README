Norm Components Matrix (NCM) algorithm for the correlation sums calculation.

The correlation sums are the building block for the evaluation of correlation dimension 
and the sample entropy -- complexity parameters useful in the (medical) time series analysis.

This is the parallel implementation written in Python language.

To run this software you have to have MPI and mpi4py installed.

The usage with the MPI interface (an output from $ pyton run.py --help):
