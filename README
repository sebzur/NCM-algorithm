Norm Components Matrix (NCM) algorithm for the correlation sums calculation.

The correlation sums are the building block for the evaluation of correlation dimension 
and the sample entropy -- complexity parameters useful in the (medical) time series analysis.

This is the parallel implementation written in Python language.
